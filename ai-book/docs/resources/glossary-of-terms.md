# Glossary of Terms

**Resources | Time: ~1 hour**

## Learning Objectives
- Familiarize yourself with key terminology used in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
- Understand the definitions of complex concepts.

## Prerequisites
- None (reference material).

## Overview
This glossary serves as an indispensable reference for navigating the rich and often complex terminology encountered in the domains of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. It provides a comprehensive, alphabetized list of key terms and their precise definitions, ensuring that readers from diverse backgrounds can maintain a consistent and accurate understanding of the concepts discussed throughout this book.

The field of Physical AI integrates principles from artificial intelligence, robotics, computer vision, control theory, and machine learning, leading to a specialized vocabulary. This resource is designed to clarify jargon, demystify technical terms, and provide quick access to essential definitions, thereby enhancing the learning experience and reinforcing foundational knowledge.

From core concepts like 'Embodied Intelligence' and 'Perception-Action Loops' to specific technologies such as 'ROS 2' (Robot Operating System 2), 'Gazebo' (robot simulator), 'Isaac Sim' (NVIDIA's physics-accurate virtual world for robotics), and 'VSLAM' (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), each entry is crafted for clarity and conciseness. Important terms related to 'Large Language Models (LLMs)' and their application in 'Vision-Language-Action (VLA)' systems are also included, reflecting the cutting-edge aspects of humanoid interaction.

Furthermore, specialized robotics terms like 'Kinematics' (the study of motion without considering forces) and 'Dynamics' (the study of motion considering forces) are defined to support a deeper technical understanding. This chapter is not intended for active learning or hands-on activities but rather as a supporting tool to ensure a solid grasp of the terminology, facilitating smoother progression through the practical modules and capstone project.

## Key Concepts
- AI: Artificial Intelligence
- Robotics: The field dealing with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots.
- ROS 2: Robot Operating System 2, a flexible framework for writing robot software.
- Gazebo: A powerful 3D robot simulator.
- Isaac Sim: NVIDIA's scalable, physics-accurate virtual world for building and operating AI-powered robots.
- VSLAM: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, a technology that uses visual input to simultaneously map an environment and track a robot's location within it.
- LLM: Large Language Model, an AI model trained on vast text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text.
- Humanoid: A robot designed to resemble the human body, typically with a torso, head, two arms, and two legs.
- Kinematics: The branch of mechanics concerned with the motion of objects without reference to the forces that cause the motion.
- Dynamics: The branch of mechanics concerned with the forces that cause objects to move and the effects of these forces on the motion.
- Perception-Action Loop: The continuous cycle where an agent senses its environment (perception), processes the information, and acts upon it (action), which in turn changes the environment and leads to new perceptions.
- Sim-to-Real Transfer: The process of training a robot policy or model in a simulation environment and then deploying it to a real-world robot.
- Multi-modal Sensing: The integration of data from multiple types of sensors (e.g., vision, touch, audio) to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the environment.
- Natural Language Understanding (NLU): A subfield of AI that focuses on enabling computers to understand human language as it is spoken and written.
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA): A paradigm in robotics where AI systems process visual and language inputs to reason and generate physical actions.
