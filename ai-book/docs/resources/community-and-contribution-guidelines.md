## Overview
This "Community and Contribution Guidelines" chapter is designed to foster a vibrant, inclusive, and productive environment for all individuals interested in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. It outlines the core principles of respect, collaboration, and constructive feedback that underpin our community. Whether you are a seasoned expert, a student, or a passionate enthusiast, your contributions are invaluable, and these guidelines aim to make your engagement as smooth and impactful as possible.

We provide a clear roadmap for various forms of contribution, starting with how to report issues effectively and suggest enhancements. For those looking to contribute code or new content, detailed steps are provided on setting up your development environment, branching strategies, commit message conventions, and pull request (PR) submission processes. This includes guidance on adhering to our code quality standards, documentation style, and testing requirements, ensuring that all contributions seamlessly integrate into the existing framework and maintain a high level of quality.

Beyond technical contributions, this chapter also encourages participation in discussions, sharing knowledge, and providing support to fellow community members. It emphasizes the importance of open communication channels, such as our Discord server (coming soon) and GitHub Discussions, for brainstorming ideas, seeking help, and collaborating on complex challenges. By following these guidelines, you not only help improve the project but also become an integral part of a growing community dedicated to advancing the field of embodied intelligence.
