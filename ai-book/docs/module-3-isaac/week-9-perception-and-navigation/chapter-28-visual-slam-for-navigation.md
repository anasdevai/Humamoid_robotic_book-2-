# Chapter 28: Visual SLAM for Navigation

**Week 9 | Module 3 | Time: ~3.5 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Integrate VSLAM outputs into a robot's navigation stack.
- Understand the role of VSLAM in global and local localization.
- Debug common issues in VSLAM-based navigation systems.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 27: Isaac ROS - Hardware-Accelerated VSLAM.

## Overview
Building on the VSLAM concepts, this chapter focuses on integrating Visual SLAM outputs directly into a robot's navigation stack. We will explore how VSLAM contributes to both global and local localization, providing crucial pose estimates for autonomous movement. Practical considerations for debugging common issues in VSLAM-based navigation systems will be covered, ensuring reliable and accurate robot navigation in various environments.

## Key Concepts
- VSLAM integration with navigation stack
- Global and local localization
- Pose estimation and map creation
- Debugging VSLAM systems

## What You'll Build
- A ROS 2 navigation stack configured to use VSLAM data.
- Navigate a simulated robot using VSLAM.
