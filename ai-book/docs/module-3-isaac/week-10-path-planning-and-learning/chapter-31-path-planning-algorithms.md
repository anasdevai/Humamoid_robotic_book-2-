# Chapter 31: Path Planning Algorithms

**Week 10 | Module 3 | Time: ~3.5 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Explore various path planning algorithms (e.g., A*, Dijkstra, RRT).
- Understand the trade-offs between different planning approaches.
- Implement a basic path planning algorithm for a simulated robot.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 30: Nav2 for Bipedal Humanoid Movement.
- Basic understanding of graph theory and search algorithms.

## Overview
This chapter provides an in-depth look at various path planning algorithms essential for autonomous robot navigation. We will explore classical algorithms like A* and Dijkstra, as well as sampling-based methods such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), analyzing their underlying principles and trade-offs. Practical implementation of a basic path planning algorithm for a simulated robot will be covered, allowing you to see these concepts in action.

## Key Concepts
- A* search algorithm
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT)
- Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM)
- Motion planning in configuration space

## What You'll Build
- Implement A* search for a grid-based robot.
- Visualize the planned path in a simulation.
