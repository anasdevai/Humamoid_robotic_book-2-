# Chapter 30: Nav2 for Bipedal Humanoid Movement

**Week 10 | Module 3 | Time: ~4 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the architecture and components of ROS 2 Nav2.
- Adapt Nav2 for path planning and navigation of bipedal humanoid robots.
- Configure global and local planners for humanoid locomotion.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 29: AI-Powered Perception.
- Strong understanding of ROS 2 (Module 1).

## Overview
This chapter delves into the advanced ROS 2 Navigation Stack (Nav2) and its adaptation for controlling bipedal humanoid movement. We will explore the architecture and key components of Nav2, focusing on how to configure global and local planners to generate stable and efficient locomotion trajectories for humanoids. Practical considerations for integrating Nav2 with humanoid kinematics and dynamics will also be discussed.

## Key Concepts
- ROS 2 Nav2 architecture
- Global and local planners
- Costmaps and obstacle avoidance
- Humanoid locomotion planning
- Integration with robot controllers

## What You'll Build
- A Nav2 configuration for a simulated bipedal humanoid.
- Demonstrate basic autonomous navigation.
