# Chapter 32: Reinforcement Learning for Robot Control

**Week 10 | Module 3 | Time: ~4.5 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for robotics.
- Apply common RL algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, PPO) to robot control tasks.
- Train a simulated robot to perform a task using RL.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 31: Path Planning Algorithms.
- Basic understanding of machine learning and calculus.

## Overview
This chapter introduces the powerful paradigm of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and its application to robot control. We will cover the fundamental concepts of RL, including agents, environments, states, actions, rewards, and policies. Practical implementation will involve applying common RL algorithms like Q-learning and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train a simulated robot to perform specific tasks, demonstrating the learning capabilities of intelligent agents.

## Key Concepts
- Reinforcement Learning basics (agent, environment, reward)
- Q-learning, Policy Gradients, PPO
- State-action spaces
- Reward function design
- Training and evaluation of RL policies

## What You'll Build
- A simulated robot trained to reach a goal using an RL algorithm.
- Visualize the learning process and policy execution.
