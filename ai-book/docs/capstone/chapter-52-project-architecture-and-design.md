# Chapter 52: Project Architecture and Design

**Capstone Project | Time: ~3 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Design a modular and scalable architecture for the autonomous humanoid project.
- Define the interfaces and communication protocols between different robot subsystems.
- Create a detailed system design document outlining components and their interactions.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 51: Capstone Project Overview.
- Strong understanding of ROS 2 architecture and design patterns.

## Overview
Building on the project overview, this chapter focuses on designing a robust and scalable architecture for the autonomous humanoid robot. We will define a modular system, outlining the interfaces and communication protocols between various subsystems such as perception, planning, and control. The chapter emphasizes creating a detailed system design document, ensuring a clear roadmap for component development and seamless integration.

## Key Concepts
- Modular robotics architecture
- System decomposition
- Inter-process communication
- Design patterns for robotics
- System design documentation

## What You'll Build
- A block diagram of the robot's software architecture.
- Interface definitions for key components.
