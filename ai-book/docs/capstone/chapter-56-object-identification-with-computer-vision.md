# Chapter 56: Object Identification with Computer Vision

**Capstone Project | Time: ~4 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Apply advanced computer vision techniques for object identification in real-time.
- Train and deploy custom object detection models for specific project needs.
- Integrate object identification results into the robot's cognitive architecture.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 55: Obstacle Avoidance.
- Chapter 29: AI-Powered Perception.

## Overview
This chapter focuses on enabling the autonomous humanoid to perceive and identify objects in its environment using advanced computer vision techniques. We will apply real-time object identification methods, covering the training and deployment of custom object detection models tailored for specific project needs. The chapter emphasizes integrating these object identification results into the robot's cognitive architecture, allowing it to understand and interact with objects intelligently.

## Key Concepts
- Real-time object detection (e.g., YOLOv7/8)
- Custom model training
- Transfer learning for object identification
- Integration with robot perception system
- Object tracking

## What You'll Build
- A real-time object detection system for the simulated humanoid.
- Train a custom object detection model for a specific object.
