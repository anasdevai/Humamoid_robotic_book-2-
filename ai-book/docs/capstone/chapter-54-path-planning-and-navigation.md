# Chapter 54: Path Planning and Navigation

**Capstone Project | Time: ~4 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Implement advanced path planning algorithms for complex environments.
- Configure and integrate a full navigation stack for the humanoid robot.
- Address dynamic obstacle avoidance and reactive navigation.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 53: Voice Command Integration.
- Chapter 30: Nav2 for Bipedal Humanoid Movement.

## Overview
This chapter focuses on implementing robust path planning and navigation capabilities for our autonomous humanoid. We will explore advanced path planning algorithms suitable for complex environments, configure and integrate a complete navigation stack (e.g., Nav2). A critical aspect will be addressing dynamic obstacle avoidance and reactive navigation strategies, ensuring the humanoid can move safely and efficiently in unforeseen situations.

## Key Concepts
- Global and local path planning
- Navigation stack (e.g., Nav2)
- Dynamic obstacle avoidance
- Reactive navigation
- Localization and mapping for real-time

## What You'll Build
- A configured navigation stack for the simulated humanoid.
- Demonstrate autonomous navigation in a complex virtual environment.
