# Chapter 59: Deployment to Simulation and Hardware

**Capstone Project | Time: ~4 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the process of deploying the autonomous humanoid to simulation environments.
- Learn to deploy and run the system on physical robot hardware.
- Evaluate real-world performance and refine deployment strategies.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 58: System Integration and Testing.
- Chapter 33: Sim-to-Real Transfer Techniques.

## Overview
This culminating chapter focuses on deploying the autonomous humanoid to both simulation environments and real robot hardware. We will detail the process of deploying the integrated system to platforms like Isaac Sim and Gazebo, and guide you through running the system on physical robot hardware, such as a Jetson-powered humanoid. The chapter emphasizes evaluating real-world performance, refining deployment strategies, and understanding the nuances of bridging the gap between simulation and reality.

## Key Concepts
- Simulation deployment workflows
- Hardware deployment strategies
- Real-world performance evaluation
- Sim-to-Real refinement
- Field testing and data collection

## What You'll Build
- Deploy the integrated humanoid system to Isaac Sim/Gazebo.
- Run the system on a physical robot (or simulate the deployment process).
