# Chapter 55: Obstacle Avoidance

**Capstone Project | Time: ~3 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Understand various techniques for obstacle detection using sensor data.
- Implement reactive and proactive obstacle avoidance strategies.
- Integrate obstacle avoidance into the robot's navigation and control system.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 54: Path Planning and Navigation.

## Overview
This chapter delves into the critical aspect of obstacle avoidance for autonomous humanoids. We will explore various techniques for detecting obstacles using diverse sensor data, and implement both reactive and proactive avoidance strategies. The focus is on seamlessly integrating these obstacle avoidance capabilities into the robot's navigation and control system, ensuring safe and robust movement in dynamic environments.

## Key Concepts
- Obstacle detection (LiDAR, depth cameras)
- Collision prediction
- Reactive avoidance behaviors
- Proactive path replanning
- Safety mechanisms for humanoids

## What You'll Build
- A simulated robot that avoids dynamic obstacles.
- Implement a local obstacle avoidance algorithm.
