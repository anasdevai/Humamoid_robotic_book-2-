# Chapter 57: Object Manipulation

**Capstone Project | Time: ~4 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Implement advanced manipulation strategies for interacting with identified objects.
- Develop grasping and placement algorithms for humanoid hands.
- Integrate manipulation capabilities into the robot's task planning.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 56: Object Identification with Computer Vision.
- Chapter 38: Manipulation with Humanoid Hands.

## Overview
This chapter focuses on enabling the autonomous humanoid to physically interact with identified objects through advanced manipulation strategies. We will develop sophisticated grasping and placement algorithms tailored for multi-fingered humanoid hands. The emphasis is on integrating these manipulation capabilities into the robot's high-level task planning, allowing it to perform complex interactions such as picking, carrying, and placing objects with precision and adaptability.

## Key Concepts
- Advanced grasping algorithms
- Object placement strategies
- Inverse kinematics for manipulation
- Force control in manipulation
- Task planning for object interaction

## What You'll Build
- A simulated humanoid robot that can pick up and place objects.
- Implement a robust manipulation sequence.
