# Chapter 58: System Integration and Testing

**Capstone Project | Time: ~3.5 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the principles of system integration for complex robotic projects.
- Develop a comprehensive testing strategy for the autonomous humanoid.
- Debug and troubleshoot integrated robotic systems effectively.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 57: Object Manipulation.

## Overview
This chapter is crucial for bringing all components of the capstone project together, focusing on system integration and comprehensive testing. We will explore principles for integrating complex robotic subsystems, develop a detailed testing strategy covering unit, integration, and system-level tests, and provide practical guidance on debugging and troubleshooting integrated robotic systems. The goal is to ensure all components work seamlessly to achieve autonomous humanoid functionality.

## Key Concepts
- Robotics system integration principles
- Unit, integration, and system testing
- Test-driven development for robotics
- Debugging tools and techniques for ROS 2 and Isaac Sim
- Performance profiling

## What You'll Build
- A set of integration tests for the humanoid robot's subsystems.
- Demonstrate a fully integrated system performing a complex task.
