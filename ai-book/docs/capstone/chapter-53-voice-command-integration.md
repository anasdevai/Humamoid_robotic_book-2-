# Chapter 53: Voice Command Integration

**Capstone Project | Time: ~3.5 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Integrate speech recognition and natural language understanding into the capstone project.
- Develop a robust voice interface for commanding the autonomous humanoid.
- Map natural language commands to specific robot actions and behaviors.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 52: Project Architecture and Design.
- Chapter 45: Multi-Modal Interaction (Speech, Gesture, Vision).

## Overview
This chapter focuses on integrating voice command capabilities into our autonomous humanoid capstone project. We will develop a robust voice interface that combines speech recognition and natural language understanding, allowing users to command the robot using spoken instructions. A key aspect will be mapping these natural language commands to specific robot actions and behaviors, enabling intuitive and conversational control of the humanoid.

## Key Concepts
- Voice interface design
- Speech-to-text (STT) integration
- Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for commands
- Command-to-action mapping
- Conversational flow for robot control

## What You'll Build
- A ROS 2 node that processes voice commands and triggers robot actions.
- Test the voice interface with simple commands.
