# Chapter 22: Simulating Humanoid Robot Kinematics and Dynamics

**Week 7 | Module 2 | Time: ~4.5 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamental principles of forward and inverse kinematics for humanoid robots.
- Implement basic kinematic control in Unity for simulated robot arms and legs.
- Explore the basics of rigid body dynamics and force application in Unity.
- Simulate complex humanoid movements and interactions with the environment.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 21: ROS 2 - Unity Integration using ROS-TCP-Connector.
- Strong understanding of linear algebra and rigid body mechanics.

## Introduction
This chapter delves into the simulation of humanoid robot kinematics and dynamics within Unity. We will cover both forward and inverse kinematics, essential for understanding and controlling robot posture and movement. You will learn to implement kinematic constraints and apply forces to simulate realistic physical interactions, laying the groundwork for complex humanoid behaviors in a high-fidelity simulation environment.

## Key Concepts
- **Forward Kinematics (FK):** Understand how to calculate the position and orientation of a robot's end-effector given its joint angles. Implement FK in Unity to visualize the robot's pose based on joint configurations.
- **Inverse Kinematics (IK):** Explore algorithms and techniques for determining the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position and orientation. Utilize Unity's built-in IK solvers or implement custom solutions for humanoid limbs.
- **Rigid Body Dynamics in Unity:** Learn about Unity's physics engine for simulating rigid body dynamics. Apply forces, torques, and manipulate physical properties (mass, inertia, friction) to create realistic robot movements and interactions.
- **Simulating Humanoid Movements:** Combine kinematic and dynamic principles to simulate complex humanoid actions such as walking, grasping, and balancing. Understand how to design trajectories and control sequences for different tasks.

## What You'll Build
- **A Unity scene with a humanoid robot:** Import a humanoid robot model and set up its rigid body components and joints.
- **Basic FK and IK control:** Implement scripts to control the robot's limbs using both forward and inverse kinematics.
- **Interactive physics simulation:** Apply forces to the robot to demonstrate basic dynamic interactions.

## Summary
We explored humanoid robot kinematics and dynamics in Unity, implementing FK/IK and leveraging the physics engine for realistic motion. This forms a crucial foundation for advanced humanoid robot simulation.
