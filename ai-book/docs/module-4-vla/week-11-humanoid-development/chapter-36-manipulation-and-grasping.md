# Chapter 36: Manipulation and Grasping

**Week 11 | Module 4 | Time: ~4 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the challenges of robotic manipulation and grasping.
- Explore different grasping strategies (e.g., force closure, form closure).
- Implement a basic grasping pipeline for a simulated humanoid hand.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 35: Bipedal Locomotion and Balance Control.

## Overview
This chapter addresses the intricate challenges of robotic manipulation and grasping, essential skills for humanoids interacting with their environment. We will explore various grasping strategies, including force closure and form closure, and analyze their suitability for different object types. The chapter culminates in the practical implementation of a basic grasping pipeline for a simulated humanoid hand, demonstrating how to approach and secure objects.

## Key Concepts
- Robotic manipulation challenges
- Grasping strategies (force, form closure)
- End-effector design
- Pre-grasp planning
- Contact mechanics

## What You'll Build
- A simulated humanoid hand performing a simple grasp.
- Implement a basic grasp planner.
