# Chapter 35: Bipedal Locomotion and Balance Control

**Week 11 | Module 4 | Time: ~4.5 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the principles of bipedal locomotion for humanoids.
- Explore different balance control strategies (e.g., ZMP, capture point).
- Implement a basic walking gait for a simulated bipedal robot.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 34: Humanoid Robot Kinematics and Dynamics.

## Overview
This chapter delves into the complex and critical domain of bipedal locomotion and balance control for humanoid robots. We will explore the biomechanical principles underpinning stable walking, examine various balance control strategies such as the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) and Capture Point methods, and culminate in the practical implementation of a basic walking gait for a simulated bipedal robot, demonstrating fundamental humanoid movement.

## Key Concepts
- Bipedal gaits
- Zero Moment Point (ZMP)
- Capture Point (CP)
- Whole-body control
- Balance and stability

## What You'll Build
- A simulation of a bipedal robot executing a basic walking gait.
- Implement a simple balance controller.
