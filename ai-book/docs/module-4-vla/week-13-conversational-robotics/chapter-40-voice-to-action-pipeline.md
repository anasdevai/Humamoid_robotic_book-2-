# Chapter 40: Voice-to-Action Pipeline

**Week 13 | Module 4 | Time: ~3.5 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the architecture of a voice-to-action pipeline for robotics.
- Identify key components: speech recognition, natural language understanding, action mapping.
- Design a high-level voice interface for a humanoid robot.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 39: Multi-Modal Sensing.

## Overview
This chapter introduces the complete voice-to-action pipeline, a crucial component for natural human-robot interaction. We will explore its architecture, identifying key stages such as speech recognition, natural language understanding, and action mapping. The focus is on designing a high-level voice interface that allows humanoids to interpret spoken commands and translate them into physical actions, enabling intuitive and conversational control.

## Key Concepts
- Speech recognition (ASR)
- Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
- Intent recognition and slot filling
- Action mapping and execution
- Conversational AI for robotics

## What You'll Build
- A conceptual design for a voice-controlled robot system.
- Outline a state machine for voice commands.
