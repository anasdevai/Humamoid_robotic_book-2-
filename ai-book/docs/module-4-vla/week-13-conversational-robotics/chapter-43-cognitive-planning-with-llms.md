# Chapter 43: Cognitive Planning with LLMs

**Week 13 | Module 4 | Time: ~4.5 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used for high-level cognitive planning in robotics.
- Design LLM-based planners to break down complex tasks into executable robot actions.
- Evaluate the strengths and limitations of LLM-driven planning.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 42: Integrating GPT Models for Conversational AI.
- Chapter 31: Path Planning Algorithms.

## Overview
This chapter explores the cutting-edge application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for high-level cognitive planning in robotics. We will investigate how LLMs can interpret abstract human goals and decompose them into a sequence of executable robot actions. The focus is on designing robust LLM-based planners, evaluating their capabilities and limitations in real-world scenarios, and understanding how they can enable robots to perform complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

## Key Concepts
- LLM-driven cognitive planning
- Task decomposition
- Action sequencing
- Reasoning and problem-solving with LLMs
- Hybrid planning architectures

## What You'll Build
- An LLM-based planner that generates a sequence of robot actions for a given high-level command.
- Simulate the execution of the planned actions.
