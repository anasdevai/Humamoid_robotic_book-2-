# Chapter 42: Integrating GPT Models for Conversational AI

**Week 13 | Module 4 | Time: ~4 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to integrate GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models for conversational AI.
- Utilize GPT for natural language understanding and response generation.
- Design prompts and manage context for effective robot conversations.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 41: Using OpenAI Whisper for Voice Commands.
- Familiarity with large language models (LLMs).

## Overview
This chapter explores the integration of advanced GPT models for creating sophisticated conversational AI in robotics. We will learn how to leverage GPT for natural language understanding, allowing robots to interpret complex human instructions, and for generating coherent and contextually relevant responses. Emphasis will be placed on effective prompt design and context management to enable engaging and meaningful robot conversations.

## Key Concepts
- GPT models for NLU and NLG
- Conversational agents
- Prompt engineering for robotics
- Context management in dialogue systems
- Ethical considerations of LLMs in HRI

## What You'll Build
- A Python script that uses GPT for natural language understanding.
- Integrate GPT with transcribed voice commands.
