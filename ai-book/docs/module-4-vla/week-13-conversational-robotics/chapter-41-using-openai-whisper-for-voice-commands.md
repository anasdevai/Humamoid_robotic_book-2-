# Chapter 41: Using OpenAI Whisper for Voice Commands

**Week 13 | Module 4 | Time: ~3 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Integrate OpenAI Whisper for accurate speech-to-text conversion in robotics.
- Understand Whisper's capabilities and limitations for real-time applications.
- Process spoken commands into text for downstream natural language understanding.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 40: Voice-to-Action Pipeline.
- Basic familiarity with Python and API usage.

## Overview
This chapter focuses on the practical application of OpenAI Whisper, a powerful speech-to-text model, for enabling voice commands in robotics. We will guide you through integrating Whisper into a robot's voice-to-action pipeline, exploring its capabilities and limitations, especially for real-time applications. The emphasis is on accurately converting spoken commands into text, which serves as the input for subsequent natural language understanding modules.

## Key Concepts
- OpenAI Whisper model
- Speech-to-text (STT) conversion
- Real-time audio processing
- API integration for AI models
- Language models for voice interfaces

## What You'll Build
- A Python script that uses Whisper to transcribe audio commands.
- Integrate Whisper with a microphone input.
