# Chapter 49: Robot Hardware Options

**Hardware & Lab Setup | Time: ~2.5 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Evaluate different robot hardware platforms suitable for Physical AI development.
- Understand the trade-offs between various robot options (e.g., wheeled, legged, humanoid).
- Select a robot platform based on project goals and budget.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 48: The Physical AI Edge Kit.

## Overview
This chapter provides an overview of various robot hardware options available for Physical AI development. We will evaluate different platforms, including wheeled robots, legged robots, and miniature humanoids, discussing their respective advantages, limitations, and cost considerations. The goal is to guide you in selecting a robot platform that best aligns with your project goals, from affordable student kits to premium research-grade humanoids.

## Key Concepts
- Wheeled robot platforms
- Legged robot platforms (quadrupeds, bipedals)
- Humanoid robot options (e.g., Unitree Go2, G1)
- Cost vs. capability trade-offs
- Open-source robot hardware

## What You'll Build
- A justified selection of a robot platform for your project.
