# Chapter 48: The Physical AI Edge Kit

**Hardware & Lab Setup | Time: ~3.5 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Select and set up components for an Edge AI kit (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano).
- Integrate common edge sensors (e.g., Intel RealSense D435i, IMUs).
- Configure voice interfaces (e.g., ReSpeaker) for edge deployment.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 47: The Digital Twin Workstation.

## Overview
This chapter focuses on building and configuring a Physical AI Edge Kit, essential for deploying AI models onto real robots. We will guide you through selecting and setting up components like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, integrating common edge sensors such as the Intel RealSense D435i depth camera and IMUs. Additionally, practical steps for configuring voice interfaces like ReSpeaker for on-device natural language interaction will be covered, enabling truly intelligent edge robotics.

## Key Concepts
- NVIDIA Jetson platform (Orin Nano, Xavier NX)
- Edge AI hardware selection
- Intel RealSense depth cameras
- IMU integration
- ReSpeaker and voice interface setup

## What You'll Build
- A configured NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano with integrated sensors.
- Set up a voice interface for local command processing.
