Project: AI-Native Book on Docusaurus Development and Deployment

Core principles:
- AI-native development using Claude Code as primary development partner
- Specification-driven approach for systematic content creation
- Technical accuracy with all code examples tested and functional
- Reader-centric design for progressive learning experience
- Maintainability through version control and modular structure

Key standards:
- Content format: Markdown/MDX files for Docusaurus compatibility
- Code quality: All examples must be syntactically correct and runnable
- Documentation structure: Logical hierarchy with max 3 levels of sidebar nesting
- Technical writing: Clear explanations for intermediate-level developers
- Deployment: Automated CI/CD pipeline to GitHub Pages
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- Performance: Page load times under 3 seconds

Constraints:
- Platform: Docusaurus v3.x (latest stable version)
- Hosting: GitHub Pages (free tier)
- Tools: Spec-Kit Plus for specifications, Claude Code for implementation
- Audience: Developers with basic JavaScript/React knowledge
- Scope: Practical implementation focus over theoretical discussion
- Dependencies: No external paid services required

Success criteria:
- Book builds without errors and deploys successfully to GitHub Pages
- All code examples tested and functional
- Complete navigation structure with working search functionality
- Responsive design validated on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- All internal and external links verified (zero 404 errors)
- Automated deployment pipeline configured and tested
- Clear README with setup and contribution instructions
- Comprehensive content covering: introduction, installation, core concepts, tutorials, and troubleshooting
- Reproducible workflow documented for AI-assisted development process

Deliverables:
- Live Docusaurus site deployed to GitHub Pages
- Complete GitHub repository with source files and configuration
- Collection of Spec-Kit Plus specifications used in development
- Meta-documentation explaining the AI-native creation process
